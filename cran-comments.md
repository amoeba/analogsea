## Reverse dependencies

I have run R CMD check on the 1 reverse dependency. (Summary at https://github.com/sckott/analogsea/blob/master/revdep/README.md). No problems were found. The maintainer was notified of the release.

This is a re-submission of the same version (the first submission of this version was accepted, but then rolled back). As requested by Brian Ripley, ssh package is now in Suggests and used conditionally.

This release includes a suite of new functions for working with Digital Ocean 
certificates and firewalls; bug fixes and some minor changes.


Thanks!
Scott Chamberlain
